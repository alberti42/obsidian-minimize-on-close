# Obsidian plugin: Minimize on Close

## Overview

This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) minimizes the application window to the dock or taskbar when all open panes are closed. This behavior is particularly standard on macOS and can now be optionally applied across all platforms.

## Features

- **MacOS-Standard Behavior**: Automatically minimize the Obsidian window when all open panes are closed, consistent with macOS application behavior.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can choose whether to restrict this behavior to macOS or apply it to all operating systems.
- **Configurable Options**: Customize the plugin to enable the minimize-on-close behavior only for macOS, or extend it to other platforms based on your preference.
- **Command Palette Support**: Includes two commands accessible from the command palette:
  - **Minimize to Icon**: Minimize the Obsidian window to the dock or taskbar.
  - **Exit Obsidian**: Completely exit the Obsidian application.
  These commands can be assigned custom hotkeys for quick access (e.g., "⌘Q" to minimize and "⌘⌥Q" to exit) from the Hotkeys configuration pane.
